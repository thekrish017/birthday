              [I know writing a message like this might feel awkward, but I wanted to be honest with you.
I’ve met you only a few times, yet every time I think of talking to you, I have many things in mind. but when I see you, I forget everything. Maybe it’s because I feel a little nervous around you.
There’s a saying that in front of our favourite person, we forget all the words we planned to say and that’s exactly what happens to me whenever I see you. I have so many things in mind, but when you’re in front of me, I just go blank.
I don’t know if anyone has ever told you this before, but you have a really beautiful smile. The kind that can make anyone else smile too. Your smile genuinely makes my day better.

2025 has been the hardest year for me. I went through two major car accidents back to back, and after that, I lost a lot of my happiness and peace. It was a very low phase in my life.

But the day I saw you for the first time in college… something changed. I don’t know how to explain it, but it felt like a little bit of happiness came back to me at that moment. That’s when I felt you were someone special.
I have a crush on you.
Having a crush on someone is not about getting into a relationship.it can simply mean being good friends that sharing problems, supporting each other, building a strong bond, and creating beautiful memories together.

I like you…

But liking someone doesn’t mean expecting the same in return. Who am I to ask you to like me back or even talk to me? It’s completely your choice, and I respect that.

All I know is that I can’t stop liking you. You’ve become someone I remember… today, tomorrow, and always.

If you’re interested talking with me and would like to build a good bond during our MTech journey, and making memories together  I’d really like that.

If you’re interested, just text me with a text that we can meet tomorrow at a time that suits you.

And if you don’t feel the same or aren’t interested,and doesn't have any feelings on me that’s completely okay. You can be honest with me — I’ll understand and respect your feelings.

Just don’t give any reply that I can understand. I won’t make you uncomfortable in any way. I wont disturb you again.This will be the my last message...

I just wanted to be clear and honest once.

I want to say one last time...
I Like You Nandanii......
